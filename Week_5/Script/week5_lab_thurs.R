### Today we are learning how to lubridate data ###
### Created by: Vivian Vy Le ###
### Updated: 2022-02-24 ###

#### load libraries ####
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(lubridate) #package for dealing with date and time

### load data ###
Depthdata <- read_csv(here("Week_5", "Data","DepthData.csv"))
CondData <- read_csv(here("Week_5","Data","CondData.csv"))

### view data ###
view(Depthdata)
view(CondData)

### data analysis ###

Depthdata_time <-Depthdata %>%
  mutate(datetime = ymd_hms(date), #the dates for this column started with year not month like in CondData
         datetime = round_date(datetime, "10 seconds")) #rounding the time to the nearest 10 second
